# Poker Analytics 

A direct implementation of hand strength estimation and hand potential in NLH Texas Hold'em Poker from [this paper](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/1998/AAAI98-070.pdf). Other techniques like preflop analysis using monte carlo simulation have also been implemented to simulate poker hands.

## Libraries Used 

* Deuces: For game simulation, hand evaluation
* PypokerEngine: For simulating poker AI which uses the hand strength and hand potential functions

## Hand Strength

## Hand Potential

## Monte Carlo Preflop Analysis

## Hand Rank Percentage
